# Geographic-TSP
Practical code for solving geographic travelling salesman problems using _routingpy_ and _pyconcorde_.

![Solution](https://mikedbjones.github.io/Geographic-TSP/gb_cities_solution.png)

I wrote a [Medium article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/solving-geographic-travelling-salesman-problems-using-python-e57284b14cd7) containing much of the same code. There are some differences: the Medium article was updated after changes were made to pyconcorde which make its installation simpler. Also, whereas the notebook here contains code to find the shortest driving route between locations in London, the article explores a larger, 79-city UK-wide problem.

When using routingpy, a number of [different routers](https://routingpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#module-routingpy.routers) can be used. Each has separate terms regarding commercial use and usage limits.
